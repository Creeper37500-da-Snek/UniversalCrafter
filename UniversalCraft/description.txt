This mod adds in a Universal Crafting Station, which functions as every Crafting Station in the Vanilla game, along with several modded ones.

If you would like a crafting station(s) to be added, or maybe a new feature when you right-click the tile, contact me on TCF or elsewhere!

Changelog: 
v1.6: Redid the right-click lists (again). Now ordered by vanilla, then four sets of mod names (A-E, F-L, M-S, T-Z). Mod names are displayed in Amber next to their respective tiles. Added a ton of tiles from a ton of mods. Cleaned up code a little. Fixed some issues.
v1.6.1: Removed the Alchemy Table functionality from post-Skeletron because it lagged the game like crazy. You can still craft things, it just doesn't have the 33% chance to not consume ingredients anymore.
v1.6.2: Fixed typo in last changelog. Added several new stations.
v1.6.3: Added two more stations.
v1.6.4: Fixed an issue dealing with Calamity, updated to tModLoader v0.11.1. Re-added support for the Alchemy Table's function and potentially fixed a multiplayer issue.
